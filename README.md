Hi there, I'm fratorgano👋
</h3>
<p align="center">
A developer who loves learning and creating innovative solutions with new technologies!
</p>

🧪 I'm currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at the [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Lab](https://anacletolab.di.unimi.it/) of the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it) 

🛠️ The main languages I use are **Python**, **Javascript** and **Rust** but my degree in computer science allows me to adapt to new languages easily. I've also used many others, including Golang, Java, Scala, C, C# and Erlang 

🌱 I’m currently learning **Rust** to learn a fun and complex new language

📖 I'm reading [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/aposd.php) by [John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) to improve my software design and coding skills
